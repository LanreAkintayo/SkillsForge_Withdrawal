Project 2: Withdrawal Contract
Create a smart contract that allows users to save Ether (ETH) and set withdrawal intervals. The
contract should enable users to withdraw their funds after a specified interval, such as monthly or
weekly.
Requirements:
● Deposit Funds: Implement a function that allows users to deposit Ether into the
contract.
● Set Withdrawal Interval: Implement a function that allows users to set their desired
withdrawal interval (e.g., monthly, weekly etc).
● Withdraw Funds: Implement a function that allows users to withdraw their funds after
the specified interval has elapsed.
Additional Features (Nice to have):
● Multiple Withdrawal Intervals: Allow users to set multiple withdrawal intervals for
different portions of their deposited funds.
● Interest Calculation: Calculate and distribute interest on the deposited funds based on the
time elapsed since the deposit.
